# Fullstack Open MOOC Exercises

## Introduction

This online course about modern software development is something I'm doing for both work and school.  As I'm working full time as a software developer, much of the content is review, but the MOOC is a good format to learn this subject thoroughly in a structured, yet flexible way.

## React vs. Angular

React and Redux are tools that I recognize as useful. We use these for projects at @Crasman and I used them at @Unity as well, but I would like to strengthen my skills.  For my own projects, I have favoured Angular, though I agree with what the course author mentioned, that the Google team really messed up the trust in the framework ecosystem with the way they have managed the versions.  Now it seems to have stabalized a bit and Angular 5 - 7 are mostly compatable, but yes it's tricky keeping packages up-to-date.

## MOOC Concept

I'm also interested in the online course as a teaching method and the way that this course's content is organized.  I am assisting in the creation of a virtual field course to teach tropical foresty research methods using 360Â° video by the University of Helsinki's Mixed Reality Hub and Viikki Tropical Resources Institute (Vitri).  I am looking to adopt common elements and practices of handling content while introducing some elements of my own, like an open source media map that could be useful for other courses.
